        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          The college owes its existence to the keen interest of Late Kandula
          Obul Reddy to develop technical education in Rayalaseema region of
          Andhra Pradesh. With a view to translating his noble ideal of
          imparting technical education into reality, a Technical Training
          Institute at Vempalli, Kadapa District was started in 1979 under the
          aegis of Sri Kandula Obul Reddy charities. It is in the year 1980 that
          K.S.R.M. College of Engineering was established to perpetuate the
          memory of Late Sri. Kandula Srinivasa Reddy, youngest son of Late Sri
          Kandula Obul Reddy. Sri Kandula Srinivasa Reddy, a brilliantstudent of
          III year Mechanical Engineering at Delhi College of Engineering, New
          Delhi, met with his untimely death in a scooter accident on 18th Oct,
          1979.
